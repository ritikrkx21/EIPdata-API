## Abstract

Currently, `SWAP` and `DUP` instructions are limited to a stack depth of 16. Introduce two new instructions, `SWAPN` and `DUPN`, which lift this limitation and allow accessing the stack up to depth of 256 items.

## Motivation

While the stack is 1024 items deep, easy access is only possible for the top 16 items. Supporting more local variables is possible via manually keeping them in memory or through a "stack to memory elevation" in a compiler. This can result in complex and inefficient code.

Furthermore, implementing higher level constructs, such as functions, on top of EVM will result in a list of input and output parameters as well as an instruction offset to return to.

The number of these arguments (or stack items) can easily exceed 16 and thus will require extra care from a compiler to lay them out in a way that all of them are still accessible.

Introducing `SWAPN` and `DUPN` will provide an option to compilers to simplify accessing deep stack items at the price of possibly increased gas costs.

## Specification

We introduce two new instructions:

 1. `DUPN` (`0xb0`)
 2. `SWAPN` (`0xb1`)

If the code is legacy bytecode, both of these instructions result in an *exceptional halt*. (*Note: This means no change to behaviour.*)

If the code is valid EOF1, the following execution rules apply:

These instructions are followed by an 8-bit immediate value, which we call `imm`, and can have a value of 0 to 255. We introduce the variable `n` which equals to `imm + 1`.

If the current stack depth is less than `n`, then a stack underflow exception is issued. If the current stack depth is at the limit, a stack overflow exception is issued. In both of these cases the EVM stops and all gas is consumed.

Otherwise
- for `DUPN` the stack item at depth `n - 1` is duplicated at the top of the stack
- for `SWAPN` the top stack item is swapped with the item at depth `n`

The gas cost for both instructions is set at 3.

## Rationale

TBA

## Backwards Compatibility

This has no effect on backwards compatibility because the opcodes were not previously allocated.

## Test Cases
