## Abstract
This EIP presents an interface for "smart proposals": proposals that are submitted to, recorded on, and possibly executed on-chain. When a smart proposal is on-chain executable, it contains information on smart-contract calls, including addresses, ether values, call data, and other metadata information.

## Motivation
It is oftentimes necessary to separate the code that is to be executed from the actual execution of the code.

A typical use case for this EIP is in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). A proposer will create a smart proposal and advocate for it. Members will then choose whether or not to endorse the proposal and vote accordingly (see [EIP-1202](./eip-1202.md)). Finallym when consensus has been formed, the proposal is executed.

A second typical use-case is that one could have someone who they trust, such as a delegator, trustee, or an attorney-in-fact, or any bilateral collaboration format, where a smart proposal will be first composed, discussed, approved in some way, and then put into execution.

A third use-case is that a person could make an "offer" to a second person, potentially with conditions. The smart proposal can be presented as an offer and the second person can execute it if they choose to accept this proposal.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity

interface IERC5247SmartProposal {
    event ProposalCreated(
        uint256 proposalId,
        string proposalUri,
        uint8[] optionIds,
        address proposer,
        address[][] targets,
        uint256[][] values,
        string[][] signatures,
        bytes[][] calldatas,
        uint256 startBlock,
        uint256 endBlock
    );
    event ProposalExecuted(uint256 proposalId);
    // TODO: add Proposal Cancel/Edit/Withdraw Event and Functions?

    // TODO: decide whether we require generating ProposalId in the method or not?
    // TODO: if require generating ProposalId internally, can it be incremental hash-generated?
    // TODO: what if proposal need to demonstrate sufficient support? How to input quorum?
    function createProposal(
        uint256 proposalId,
        string calldata proposalUri,
        uint8[] calldata optionIds,
        address[] calldata targets,
        uint256[] calldata values,
        bytes[] calldata calldatas,
        uint256 startblock,
        uint256 endblock,
        bytes calldata extraParams
    ) external returns (uint256 registeredProposalId);

    // TODO: what's most proper way to update the voting period?
    // TODO: do we want to include cancel or withdraw?
    // TODO: what's the best way to include weight scheme?
}
```

## Rationale

* Originally, this interface was part of part of [EIP-1202](./eip-1202.md). However, the proposal itself can potentially have many use cases outside of voting. It is possible that voting may not need to be upon a proposal in any particular format. Hence, we decide to *decouple the voting interface and proposal interface*.
* Arrays were used for `target`s, `value`s, `calldata`s instead of single variables, allowing a proposal to carry arbitrarily long multiple functional calls.
* `registeredProposalId` is returned in `createProposal` so the standard can support implementation to decide their own format of proposal id.
