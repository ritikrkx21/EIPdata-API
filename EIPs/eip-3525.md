## Simple Summary

This is a standard for semi-fungible tokens. The set of smart contract interfaces described in this document defines an ERC-721 extension/compatible token standard. This standard introduces an <ID, SLOT, VALUE> triple scalar model that represents the semi-fungible structure of a token. It also introduces new transfer models as well as approval models that reflect the semi-fungible nature of the tokens.

## Abstract

ERC-3525 is an ERC-721 compatible token standard, where each ERC-3525 token, like an ERC-721 token, contains an ID property to identify itself as a universally unique entity, so that the tokens can be transferred between addresses and approved to be operated in ERC-721 compatible way.

ERC-3525 tokens also contain a 'value' property, representing the quantitative nature of the token. The meaning of the 'value' property is quite like that of the 'balance' property of an ERC-20 token. Each ERC-3525 token has a 'slot' attribute, ensuring that the value of two ERC-3525 tokens with the same slot be treated as fungible, adding fungibility to the value property of the tokens.

ERC-3525 introduces new token transfer models for semi-fungibility,  including value transfer between two tokens of the same slot and value transfer from a token to an address.

## Motivation

Tokenization is one of the most important trends by which to use and control digital assets in crypto. Traditionally, there are two approaches to do so: fungible and non-fungible tokens. Fungible tokens are generally powered by ERC-20 standard, where every unit of an asset is identical to each other. ERC-20 is a flexible and efficient way to manipulate fungible tokens. Non-fungible tokens are predominantly ERC-721 tokens, powered by a standard capable of distinguishing digital assets from one another based on identity. 

However, both have significant drawbacks. For example, ERC-20 requires that users create a separate ERC-20 contract for each individual data structure or combination of customizable properties, resulting in an unrealistic amount of ERC-20 contracts that need to be created in practice. On the other hand, ERC-721 tokens provide no quantitative feature, hence significantly undercutting their computability, liquidity, and manageability. For example, if we are to create financial instruments such as bonds, insurance policy, vesting plans using ERC-721, no standard interfaces are available for us to control the value in them, making it impossible, for example, to transfer a portion of the equity in the contract represented by the token. 

A more intuitive and straightforward way to solve the problem is to create a semi-fungible token that has the quantitative features of ERC-20 and qualitative attributes of ERC-721. The backwards-compatibility of such semi-fungible tokens would help utilize existing infrastructures already in use and lead to faster adoption.

The slot's enumeration extension is OPTIONAL for ERC-3525 smart contracts. This allows your contract to publish its full list of SLOT and make them discoverable.

The slot level approval is OPTIONAL for ERC-3525 smart contracts. This allows any contract that wants to support approval for slots, which allows an operator to manage one's tokens with the same slot.
```solidity

### ERC-3525 Token Receiver

Smart contracts MUST implement all of the functions in the IERC3525Receiver interface to accept transfers. See "Safe Transfer Rules" for further detail.

```solidity
 pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @title ERC3525 token receiver interface
 * @dev Interface for any contract that wants to support safeTransfers from ERC3525 contracts.
 * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x009ce20b.
 */
interface IERC3525Receiver {
    /**
     * @notice Handle the receipt of an ERC3525 token value.
     * @dev An ERC3525 smart contract MUST call this function on the recipient contract after a 
     *  value transfer (i.e. `safeTransferFrom(uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)`).
     *  MUST return 0x009ce20b (i.e. `bytes4(keccak256('onERC3525Received(address,uint256,uint256,
     *  uint256,bytes)'))`) if the transfer is accepted.
     *  MUST revert or return any value other than 0x009ce20b if the transfer is rejected.
     * @param _operator The address which triggered the transfer
     * @param _fromTokenId The token id to transfer value from
     * @param _toTokenId The token id to transfer value to
     * @param _value The transferred value
     * @param _data Additional data with no specified format
     * @return `bytes4(keccak256('onERC3525Received(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)'))` 
     *  unless the transfer is rejected.
     */
    function onERC3525Received(address _operator, uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external returns (bytes4);

}
```

### Token Manipulation

#### Scenarios

**_Transfer:_**

Besides ERC-721 compatible token transfer methods, ERC-3525 introduces two new transfer models: value transfer from ID to ID, and value transfer from ID to address.

```solidity
1. function transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 _value) external payable;
   function safeTransferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external payable;
	
2. function transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, address _to, uint256 _value) external payable returns (uint256 toTokenId_);
   function safeTransferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, address _to, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external payable returns (uint256 toTokenId_);
```


The first one allows value transfers from one token (specified by `_fromTokenId`) to another token (specified by `_toTokenId`) with the same slot, as a result, the `_value` will be subtracted from the value of the source token and added to the value of the destination token; 

The second one allows value transfers from one token (specified by `_fromTokenId`) to an address (specified by `_to`), the value is actually transferred to a token owned by the address, and the id of the destination token should be returned. Further explanation can be found in the 'design decision' section for this method.


#### Rules

**_approving rules:_**

ERC-3525 provides four kinds of approving functions indicating different levels of approvals, which can be described as full level approval, slot level approval, token ID level approval as well as value level approval.

- `setApprovalForAll`, compatible with ERC721, SHOULD indicate the full level of approval, which means that the authorized operators are capable of managing all the tokens, including their values, owned by the owner.
- `setApprovalForSlot` (optional) SHOULD indicate the slot level of approval, which means that the authorized operators are capable of managing all the tokens with the specified slot, including their values, owned by the owner.
- The token ID level `approve` function, compatible with ERC721, SHOULD indicate that the authorized operator is capable of managing only the specified token ID, including its value, owned by the owner.
- The value level `approve` function, SHOULD indicate that the authorized operator is capable of managing the specified maximum value of the specified token owned by the owner.
- For any approving function, the caller MUST be the owner or has been approved with a higher level of authority.

**_transferFrom rules:_**

- The `transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 _value)` function, SHOULD indicate value transfers from one token to another token, in accordance with the rules below:

  - MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_fromTokenId`, an authorized operator or an operator who has been approved the whole token or at least `_value` of it.
  - MUST revert if `_fromTokenId` or `_toTokenId` is zero token id or does not exist.
  - MUST revert if slots of `_fromTokenId` and `_toTokenId` do not match.
  - MUST revert if `_value` exceeds the value of `_fromTokenId` or its allowance to the operator.
  - MUST emit `TransferValue` event.

- The `transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, address _to, uint256 _value)` function, which transfers value from one token ID to an address, SHOULD follow the rule below:

  - MUST create a new ERC3525 token with the same slot to receive the transferred value.
  - MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_fromTokenId`, an authorized operator or an operator who has been approved the whole token or at least `_value` of it.
  - MUST revert if `_fromTokenId` is zero token id or does not exist.
  - MUST revert if `_to` is zero address.
  - MUST revert if `_value` exceeds the value of `_fromTokenId` or its allowance to the operator.
  - MUST emit `Transfer` and `TransferValue` events.

**_safeTransferFrom rules:_**

- `safeTransferFrom` SHOULD be used to implement the same function as `transferFrom`, with an extra step to check if the recipient is capable of receiving ERC-3525 tokens by implementing the `onERC3525Received` interface.
- MUST follow the above rules set for `transferFrom`.
- MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (code size > 0). If so, `safeTransferFrom` MUST call `onERC3525Received` on `_to` and MUST revert if the return value does not match `bytes4(keccak256("onERC3525Received(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))`

### Metadata

#### Metadata Extensions

ERC-3525 metadata extensions are compatible ERC-721 metadata extensions.

The optional ERC3525Metadata extension can be identified with the ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @title ERC-3525 Semi-Fungible Token Standard, optional extension for metadata
 * @dev Interfaces for any contract that wants to support query of the Uniform Resource Identifier
 *  (URI) for the ERC3525 contract as well as a specified slot. 
 *  Because of the higher reliability of data stored in smart contracts compared to data stored in 
 *  centralized systems, it is recommended that metadata, including `contractURI`, `slotURI` and 
 *  `tokenURI`, be directly returned in JSON format, instead of being returned with a url pointing 
 *  to any resource stored in a centralized system. 
 *  See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525
 * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xe1600902.
 */

     *  See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525 for the JSON schema for contract URI.
     * @return The JSON formatted URI of the current ERC3525 contract
     */
    function contractURI() external view returns (string memory);

    /**

     *  See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525 for the JSON schema for slot URI.
     * @return The JSON formatted URI of `_slot`
     */
    function slotURI(uint256 _slot) external view returns (string memory);
}

## Rationale

### Metadata generation

The ERC-3525 token standard is designed to represent semi-fungible assets, which are most suited for financial instruments rather than collectibles or in-game items. For maximum transparency and safety of digital assets, the implementation should generate metadata directly from contract code rather than giving out a server URL.

### Design decision: Value transfer from token to address

The 'value' of an ERC-3525 token is a property of the token and is not linked to an address, so to transfer the value to an address would be actually transferring it to a token owned by that address, not the address itself.

From the implementation perspective, the process of transferring values from token to address could be done as follows: (1) create a new token for the recipient's address, (2) transfer the value to the new token from the 'source token'. So that this method is not fully independent from the ID-to-ID transfer method, and can be viewed as syntactic sugar that wraps the process described above.


In a special case, if the destination address owns one or more tokens with the same slot value as the source token, this method will have an alternative implementation as follows: (1) find one token owned by the address with the same slot value of the source token, (2) transfer the value to the found token. Both implementation should be treated as compliant with this standard.

The purpose of maintaining id-to-address transfer function is to maximize the compatibility with most wallet apps, since for most of the token standards, the destination of token transfer are addresses. This syntactic wrapping will help wallet apps easily implement the value transfer function from an ERC-3525 token to any address.

### Design decision: Keep unsafe transfer

There are mainly two reasons we keep the unsafe transfer interfaces:

1. Since ERC-3525 token is ERC-721 compatible, we must keep compatibility for all wallets and contracts that are still calling unsafe transfer interfaces for ERC-721 tokens.
2. We want to keep the ability that dapps can trigger business logic on contracts by simply transferring ERC-3525 tokens to them, that is, a contract can put business logic in `onERC3525Received` function so that it can be called whenever a token is transferred using `safeTransferFrom`. However, in this situation, an approved contract with customized transfer functions like deposit etc. SHOULD never call `safeTransferFrom` since it will result in confusion that whether `onERC3525Received` is called by itself or other dapps that call the safeTransferFrom function.


### Design decision: Relationship between different approval models

For semantic compatibility with ERC-721 as well as the flexibility of value manipulation of tokens, we decided to define the relationships between some of the levels of approval like that:

1. Approval of an id will lead to the ability to partially transfer values from this id by the approved operator, this will simply the value approval for an id. However, the approval of total values in a token should not lead to the ability to transfer the token entity by the approved operator.
2. setApprovalForAll will lead to the ability to partially transfer values from any token, as well as the ability to approve partial transfer of values from any token to a third party, this will simply the value transfer and approval of any tokens owned by an address.


## Backwards Compatibility

As mentioned in the beginning, ERC-3525 is an extension interface of ERC-721, and therefore 100% compatible with the latter.
